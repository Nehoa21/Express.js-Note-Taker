# Express.js Note Taker

## Description

This program is a application that allows you to create simple notes. Instead of having sticky notes hanging around everywhere, make and keep these notes on your computer. Add as many as you'd like, keep them saved, and delete them as you wish. Keep in mind that it runs through the terminal and can be accessed from `http://localhost:3001` from your web browser. Because it runs through your `localhost`, the data is easily managed locally and can't be accessed through the web. Follow the instructions in the `Installation` and `Usage` sections below on how to run it.
